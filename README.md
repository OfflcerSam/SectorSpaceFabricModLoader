# SSFML - Sector Space Fabric Mod Loader

A [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) bridge that lets [Sector Space](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3978250/Sector_Space/) load Fabric-style Mixin mods.

This is a work in progress fork, it is unofficial, not entirely affiliated with the developer of Sector Space.

Thank you, Darenkel for initial setup of the SSFML files.

See Official Sector Space discord for communication.

## How it works

SSFML wraps Fabric Loader's `Knot` launcher and tells it how to boot Sector Space as its "game," using a custom `GameProvider` (`SectorSpaceProvider`) instead of a native Fabric integration. Mods are discovered from a `mods/` folder next to the game jar, controlled by a simple config file.

## Requirements

- **JDK 25** or later (set via Gradle toolchain, Gradle will resolve this automatically if not already installed via the Foojay resolver plugin)
- Your own copy of **`Sector Space.jar`**, placed in `app/libs/`

`Sector Space.jar` is **not included** in this repository, it's the game's own file and isn't SSFML's to redistribute. Copy it from your Sector Space install directory into `app/libs/` before building.

## Building

```bash
./gradlew jar    # Linux/macOS
gradlew.bat jar  # Windows
```

The built jar is written to `app/build/libs/`.

### Testing

```bash
./gradlew test    # Linux/macOS
gradlew.bat test  # Windows
```

Covers the version-comparison logic used by the mod dependency checker (`VersionComparisonTest`) and `ModLoader`'s file-based operations.
Everything runs against a temp directory built per test.
Test output goes to `app/build/test-results/` and `app/build/reports/tests/`.
These are covered by the existing `**/build/` rule in `.gitignore`.

## Installing

1. Build or download a release build if one is available.
2. Place the built jar in your Sector Space install directory (wherever `Sector Space.jar` actually lives), or anywhere you want to run it.
3. Run it once so it installs needed libs and generates a mod folder and config. On first launch outside game directory, a setup window opens asking you to locate your Sector Space install, this only happens once and is saved for future launches.

## Modding

1. Drop mod `.jar` files into the `mods/` folder next to your Sector Space install (created automatically on first run).
2. Start the game once. SSFML looks through `mods/` and generates a `mods/mod_list.cfg`, listing every mod it found:

   ```
   # Auto-generated mod list, start game to update.
   # Otherwise, add in per-line format: ExJar.jar, true/false
   ExampleMod.jar, false
   ```

3. Every mod is **disabled (false) by default**. Edit `mod_list.cfg` and set the mods you want to `true`.
4. Restart the game to apply mods. Only mods marked `true` will load. `mod_list.cfg` is re-synced against the `mods/` folder on every launch, new jars appear as `false`, and jars you remove disappear from the list automatically.

### Mod dependencies

SSFML reads each enabled mod's `fabric.mod.json` and does a best-effort check of its `depends` block before launch, logging whether each requirement looks satisfied. This is informational only, it never disables a mod or blocks launch on its own.

Four kinds of dependencies are recognized:
- `sector-space` - checked against the currently verified game version
- `fabricloader` - checked against the running Fabric Loader version
- `java` - checked against the current JRE version
- any other mod's own `id` - checked against that mod's `id`/`version` if it's also enabled in `mods/`

Example `fabric.mod.json`:
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "offlcersam_modtest",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "ModTest",
  "description": "Sector Space test mod.",
  "environment": "*",

  "mixins": [
     "modtest.mixins.json"
  ],

  "depends": {
     "fabricloader": ">=0.18.4", 
     "java": ">=25", 
     "sector-space": ">=0.5.9.6", 
     "offlcersam_modexamplelib": ">=1.0.0"
  },

  "contact": {
    "homepage": "",
    "sources": "",
    "issues": ""
  }
}
```
Results are printed to the console and `SSFML_startup_log.txt` on every launch, including a log message if a dependency is found but currently disabled versus not being installed at all.

Do not put SSFML as a depends requirement, it cannot detect itself.
Contact I think is correct metadata for fabricloader, so is "custom".

Example `modtest.mixin.json`:
```json
{
  "required": true,
  "minVersion": "0.8",
  "package": "modtest.mixin",
  "compatibilityLevel": "JAVA_17",
  "mixins": [
     "ExampleMixin",
     "OtherExampleMixin"
  ],
  "injectors": {
    "defaultRequire": 1
  }
}
```
Sector Space isn't obfuscated, so mixins should stay unmapped.

`"package"` is the folder your mixin classes live in (`modtest/mixin/ExampleMixin.java`).

Each mixin class needs `remap = false` set on its `@Mixin` annotation, since there's no official mappings to remap against:
```java
@Mixin(value = SomeGameClass.class, remap = false)
public class ExampleMixin {
    // @Inject / @Redirect / etc.
}
```

### Mod config

SSFML ships a small config API instead: `com.sector.bridge.SSFMLConfig`. 
A mod declares its config as a schema (key, default value, optional comment) and loads it once.
SSFML resolves the file location, creates it if missing, and reconciles it against whatever's already on disk if it exists.

Config lives at `config/<modId>/<modId>.cfg`, resolved automatically via Fabric's own `FabricLoader.getInstance().getGameDir()`

```java
private static final List<SSFMLConfig.ConfigEntry> SCHEMA = List.of(
        new SSFMLConfig.ConfigEntry("maxDroneCount", "5", "Max drones a station can spawn"),
        new SSFMLConfig.ConfigEntry("dronesEnabled", "true")
);

private static final SSFMLConfig.Config CONFIG = SSFMLConfig.load("weaponfoundry", SCHEMA);

int maxDrones = CONFIG.getInt("maxDroneCount");
boolean enabled = CONFIG.getBoolean("dronesEnabled");

CONFIG.set("maxDroneCount", 8);
CONFIG.save();
```

On every load, a schema key missing from the file gets added with its default value, and an active key no longer in the schema gets commented out 
(once, with its last known value preserved) rather than deleted outright. 
Plain descriptive comments and blank lines in the file aren't preserved verbatim across a save.
They're regenerated fresh from the current schema every time, so hand-editing structure (as opposed to values) won't stick.

## Logs

If something goes wrong, check `SSFML_startup_log.txt` in your game folder, it mirrors everything printed to the console to a plain text file.
Logging also currently includes all application logging as well (mods, game, etc), just to unify it into one place.

Mods can also use `com.sector.bridge.SSFMLLogger` for their own logging, since the in-game modlogger is being deprecated and could no longer reliable:
```java
SSFMLLogger.log("something happened");
SSFMLLogger.info("modID", "Loaded 10 weapons");
SSFMLLogger.warn("modID", "Something looked off, but continuing");
SSFMLLogger.error("modID", "Something actually broke");
```

modID must be entered on the mod side, it is not automatically gotten. Otherwise, you can use .log and just manually tag ModName for reference.

    LocVerifierApp.java         - First-run setup UI if not in game directory.
    LocVerifierCFG.java         - Persisted config for game path and version.
    SSFMLLogger.java            - Mod-facing logging API, routes into SSFML_startup_log.txt

## Contributing

This is a personal for fun project and fork of the original SSFML code to clean things up, this code might not have to change and will probably be kept minimal to ensure future compatibility.
Though additional forks are always fun so feel free to fork, make issues, PRs, etc.

Note: This fork of SSFML will try to be as minimal to interacting with the game as possible, theoretically the only thing that would break this in the future is the `game.Main` being altered or moved.
